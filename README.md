<h1>PROFESSIONAL NETWORKING </h1>



<h2>REFLECTION WITH STAR TECHNIQUE</h2>
<br>
Situation:
I participated in a tutorial about Professional Networking, which explored how to build meaningful professional relationships and use networking to support career growth.
<br/>

<br>
Task:
My goal was to learn how to connect with professionals in my field, create a strong personal brand, and use networking platforms effectively to find new opportunities.

<br>
Action:
In the tutorial, I learned how to create and maintain a professional LinkedIn profile, write an engaging summary, and reach out to potential connections. I practiced introducing myself professionally and learned how to follow up after networking events or meetings. I also explored strategies for online networking and joining relevant professional groups.
<br />

<br>
Result:
As a result, I now have a stronger understanding of how to network strategically and professionally. I feel more confident reaching out to others in my industry and maintaining those connections. Networking no longer feels intimidating—it feels like a valuable and continuous part of career development.
